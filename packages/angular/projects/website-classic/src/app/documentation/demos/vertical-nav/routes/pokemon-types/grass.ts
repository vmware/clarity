  Grass is one of the three basic elemental types along with Fire and Water, 
  which constitute the three starter Pokémon. This creates a simple triangle 
  to explain the type concept easily to new players.
</p>            
<p>
  Grass is one of the weakest types statistically, with 5 defensive weaknesses 
  and 7 types that are resistant to Grass moves. Furthermore, many Grass Pokémon 
  have Poison as their secondary type, adding a Psychic vulnerability. 
  The type combination with the most weaknesses is Grass/Psychic.
