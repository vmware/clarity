    The Poison type is regarded as one of the weakest offensively. 
    Prior to Pokémon X/Y it was super-effective only against Grass 
    (many of which are dual Poison so neutralizes the effect). It now has an 
    extra advantage against the new Fairy type. In the first generation it was 
    also super-effective against Bug but this was changed. It fares a little better 
    defensively but its best advantage is through status moves like Toxic.
